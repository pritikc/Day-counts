<!-- There are 1000 milliseconds in a second (1000 ms = 1 s).
There are 60 seconds in a minute (60 s = 1 min).
There are 60 minutes in an hour (60 min = 1 hour).
There are 24 hours in a day. -->

<!-- 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 86,400,000 -->

<!-- Therefore, there are 86,400,000 milliseconds in a day. -->


<!--  Math.ceil() to round each number up to the nearest integer and store the results  -->

<!--  Math.abs() always returns a positive number, even if the input number is negative. -->
